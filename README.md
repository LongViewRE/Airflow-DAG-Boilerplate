# Airflow DAG Boilerplate 

This repository represents a boilerplate package for writing DAGs at LongView. 

For more information follow this link her for the [documentation](https://longviewre.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TD/pages/917540/Writing+and+Deploying+a+DAG)

## Getting Set Up

The best practice for using this code is to create a new project folder named specifically for the function the DAG will be performing. 

ex. TA_Reporting (A DAG repository for data orchestration regarding TA Reporting)

Then in Github create a new repository that corresponds to that project folder. 

Then pull this respository 

```bash

git pull https://github.com/LongViewRE/airflow_dags.git

```

This will pull the directory and its contents but any modifications you make will be pushed to the project's repository not this one.
